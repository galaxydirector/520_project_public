\Paragraph{Logistic Regression}
We use the Logistic Regression package provided in scikit-learn library and runs the experiment in python. We firstly perform a parameter search over 5-fold cross-validation over the entire training set for different words. We tested different regularization values, solvers, multiclass metrics. Finally we found that in most cases by setting C=1, solver=``newtown\_cg'', max\_iter = 500, and metric=``multinomial'' we can get the best accuracy and f1 scores. We'll set them to be the global parameters over logistic regression classifier for each word.
