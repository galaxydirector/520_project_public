\section{Conclusion}
(Neural net discussion) Because the dataset is very small, the simplified neural network model remains severely underfit. More data is required to train the model in order to improve the performance instead of adding more features into the dataset. The network was originally designed for the whole sentence processing, so as long as given a sufficient dataset, there is a huge potential to give a better result. For future work, each dilation block could be replaced by LSTM, which is also proven strong at time series type data processing.
