\section{Introduction}

We rely on Google to retrive information. The typical way we interact with
search engines is typing in query using natural languages. However English
words have different meanings in different contexts. A major challenge to
precisely retrive the desired information is to understand the meaning
of a word in a given context.

To solve this problem, We want to build a word sense disambiguate system that
takes an English word and a sentence where it appears as input, and predicts the
sense of such word with regard to the given context. By substituing the key
words with paraphases of the same sense, the search engine can retrive more
complete set of results for a given user query.
