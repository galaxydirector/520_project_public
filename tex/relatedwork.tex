Word Sense Disambiguiation. Knowledge based appraoch.
Lesk's algorithm~\cite{lesk1986automatic} is a
dictionary-based approach. It assumes that words appear within the same context
have related semantics. The alogrithm disambiguate word sense by finding the
dictionary definition that shares the most common words with the given context
sentence.

Supervised learning approaches. These approaches typically use a hand-annotated
Corpus as the training data set. The classifier is concerned on each individual
word, and the output is one of the definition of the ambiguous word in the
dictionary. Over the decades, people have proposed different algorithms to solve
this classification problem, C4.5 Algorithm~\cite{quinlan1986induction} is a decision-tree
algorithm,
